# Teeth Eximination Simulator For Phantom-omni haptic device

This Unity project contains my 4th grade thesis for computer engineering bachelor's. The purpose of this project is to create an accurate and deliberate environment for Dentist students, with the help of Phantom-Omni haptic device. To be more precise, the eximination process the user going through will be a cavity cleaning/filling situation. For real usage purposes, the movement speed / the impact effect of haptics are going to be evaluated based on image processing of certain professionals at work.

(for 1394 port phantom-omni's)

# How to detect and clear the cavity's particules?

We wish to aim for dividing accurate 3D Objects with decent and realistic enough tetrahedrons. For upgrading purposes, we are inspired by this blender project : https://github.com/matthias-research/pages/blob/master/tenMinutePhysics/BlenderTetPlugin.py



## What are the current goals?

- Dividing a tetrahedron into asymmetrical tetrahedrons.(Since symmetrical ones are impossible)

- Creating an image processing code with pixel accurate speed measurement.

- Acquiring a more accurate jaw model (3D) and a sond model.

- Making the simulation work fine without the haptic device.

- Optimization for haptic device movement, dampen strength ...etc. values.
